            Olive is a safe and simple way to prioritize health and wellbeing.
            It takes a holistic approach in helping the user take care of themselves.
            With three core functions, Olive lets users organize their medical records,
            access a range of health resources, and keep a check on their fitness journey to ultimately achieve their best selves.

          Olive has been divided into three core features, which is what I wanted to focus on while creating the user flow.
          The user can stay organized by uploading their important documents to Olive. Furthermore, Olive is a vast world of knowledge for a health conscious individual,
          which is easily accessible even to a user without an Olive account through the Health Resources feed.
          And lastly, Olive allows users to connect their phones or smartwatches to their accounts for an easier insight into their fitness.
          All these features together comprise of Olive that open a world of opportunities for the user to prioritize their health and wellbeing.

      <div>
        <p>
          The site has been divided into three broad categories that are the core functions of Olive.
          These categories are Medical Records, Health Resources and Fitness Tracker.
          The sitemap has been through several iterations to achieve a logical and seamless user flow.
          The final sitemap can be viewed in the picture below followed by a snapshot of refinement that it has been through over time.

      <div>
        <p>
          Wireframes were sketched out on my iPad, which allowed me to make mistakes,
          therefore the first draft of low-fi wireframes had already been through many stages of iterations.
          When it was the right time, I started digitizing these on Figma to create mid-fi wireframes.

        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>

      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          I conducted a round of usability tests with six participants to reveal critical insights.
          All the participants had some past experience interacting with either a wellness or a fitness app,
          if not both which helped me refine Olive.

        <h2>Research Analysis</h2>

      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          I utilized a rainbow spreadsheet to analyze the research.
          I categorized everything into four main categories-- Positives, errors, observations and negatives.
          This helped me narrow down the important functionality errors that were crucial to address.
          I was also able to validate the design through observations and positive remarks.

        <h2>Prototype</h2>

      <div>
        <p>
          The final prototype has been through several iterations and can successfully achieve the core tasks.
          However, there in the world of design-- there is always room for improvement, which is why the designer will continue to improve the prototype.
